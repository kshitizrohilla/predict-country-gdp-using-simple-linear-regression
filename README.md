# Predicting country's gdp using simple linear regression

This project aims to predict the per capita income of Canada for a given year, based on the country's adjusted net per capita income. Specifically, the project will use historical data on Canada's income levels to develop a predictive model that can estimate the per capita income of a given year, such as 2020 or 2022.

The data is stored in a CSV file named `canada-per-capita-income.csv`.

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* scikit-learn

These libraries can be installed using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To use this project, simply clone or download the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the analysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. This Notebook contains the code and explanations for loading and exploring the dataset, training a linear regression model, and visualizing the results.

The Notebook is divided into sections that correspond to different parts of the analysis, and each section includes detailed comments and explanations. You can run each section by clicking on the cell and pressing Shift+Enter.
